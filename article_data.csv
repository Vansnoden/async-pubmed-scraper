0,13,"Implementing malaria control in South Africa, Eswatini and southern Mozambique during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare delivery systems in a number of southern African countries. Despite this, it is imperative that malaria control and elimination activities continue, especially to reduce as far as possible the number and rate of hospitalisations caused by malaria. The implementation of enhanced malaria control/elimination activities in the context of COVID-19 requires measures to protect healthcare workers and the communities they serve. The aim of this review is therefore to present innovative ideas for the timely implementation of malaria control without increasing the risk of COVID-19 to healthcare workers and communities. Specific recommendations for parasite and vector surveillance, diagnosis, case management, mosquito vector control and community outreach and sensitisation are given.","['1 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa; Wits Research Institute for Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. lucilleb@nicd.ac.za.']","B D Brooke, J Raman, J Frean, J Rundle, F Maartens, E Misiani, A Mabuza, K I Barnes, D P Moonasar, Q Dlamini, S Charles, L Blumberg, ",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403980,False,,

2,17,Cerebral malaria,"Malaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.","['1 Department of Parasitology, National Institute of Biomedical Research, BP 1187 Kinshasa, Gombe, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

3,12,Current Situation of Malaria in Africa,"Malaria infection is one of the major causes of deaths in the African continent. The high burden of malaria in Africa is due to P. falciparum, which adapts and cospecializes with Anopheles gambiae, the most effective and widespread malaria vector. Since 2000, the incidence of malaria has been reduced by 17% and malaria mortality rates by 26%. However, the rate of decline has stalled and even reversed in some regions since 2014. In 2017 as described by the latest World malaria report, 219 million malaria cases were reported, up from 2017 million cases reported in 2016 in 91 countries, and the global tally of malaria deaths reached 435,000 deaths, compared with 451,000 estimated deaths in 2016. Despite these achievements, the African region continues to account for about 92% of malaria cases and deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is important to master the current situation of malaria in Africa to see how to better plan its elimination. In this chapter, we present the current situation and prospective means to improve it, including a salutogenesis approach.","['1 Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé 1, Yaoundé, Cameroon. wfmbacham@yahoo.com.', '2 Malaria Research Unit, Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaoundé, Cameroon.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé 1, Yaoundé, Cameroon.', '4 Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation, Yaoundé, Cameroon.']","Wilfred Fon Mbacham, Lawrence Ayong, Magellan Guewo-Fokeng, Valerie Makoge, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",NO_DATE,Africa; Burden; Malaria; Salutogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31267491,False,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9550-9_2,
4,16,Mathematical modeling of climate change and malaria transmission dynamics: a historical review,"Malaria, one of the greatest historical killers of mankind, continues to claim around half a million lives annually, with almost all deaths occurring in children under the age of five living in tropical Africa. The range of this disease is limited by climate to the warmer regions of the globe, and so anthropogenic global warming (and climate change more broadly) now threatens to alter the geographic area for potential malaria transmission, as both the Plasmodium malaria parasite and Anopheles mosquito vector have highly temperature-dependent lifecycles, while the aquatic immature Anopheles habitats are also strongly dependent upon rainfall and local hydrodynamics. A wide variety of process-based (or mechanistic) mathematical models have thus been proposed for the complex, highly nonlinear weather-driven Anopheles lifecycle and malaria transmission dynamics, but have reached somewhat disparate conclusions as to optimum temperatures for transmission, and the possible effect of increasing temperatures upon (potential) malaria distribution, with some projecting a large increase in the area at risk for malaria, but others predicting primarily a shift in the disease's geographic range. More generally, both global and local environmental changes drove the initial emergence of P. falciparum as a major human pathogen in tropical Africa some 10,000 years ago, and the disease has a long and deep history through the present. It is the goal of this paper to review major aspects of malaria biology, methods for formalizing these into mathematical forms, uncertainties and controversies in proper modeling methodology, and to provide a timeline of some major modeling efforts from the classical works of Sir Ronald Ross and George Macdonald through recent climate-focused modeling studies. Finally, we attempt to place such mathematical work within a broader historical context for the ""million-murdering Death"" of malaria.","['1 Global Security Initiative, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. seikenbe@asu.edu.', '2 School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. seikenbe@asu.edu.', '3 School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.']","Steffen E Eikenberry, Abba B Gumel, ",Journal of mathematical biology,NO_DATE,Climate change; Malaria; Ross–Macdonald; Thermal-response.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29691632,False,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-018-1229-7,

The objective of this study was to estimate the prediction ability of vector species associated with the prediction power of environmental and socio-economic factors for malaria risk. Logistic regression was used for malaria risk estimation. A Radial Basis Function model was applied for estimating the predictive ability of Anopheles species, environmental and socio-economic factors. The lowest fever prevalence was found where Anopheles melas was dominant. Anopheles coluzzi and Anopheles gambiae were the dominant species where prevalence of malaria was high. Altitude, country and vector species were the best predictive factors. Anopheles arabiensis, An. coluzzi and An. gambiae were most common in urban areas. This study will improve the prediction of malaria risk in targeted areas. We have observed how important it is to adapt health policies according to the dominant malaria vector in a region.","['1 Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Clinical Research Center, School of Public Health, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Campus Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.']","Elvire Mfueni Bikundi, Yves Coppieters, ",International journal of environmental health research,NO_DATE,Anopheles; Malaria; Sub-Saharan Africa; environmental characteristics; radial basis function.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32279543,False,https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2020.1745763,

8,9,The genomics of insecticide resistance: insights from recent studies in African malaria vectors,"Over 80% of the world's population is at risk from arthropod-vectored diseases, and arthropod crop pests are a significant threat to food security. Insecticides are our front-line response for controlling these disease vectors and pests, and consequently the increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance is of global concern. Here we provide a brief overview of how genomics can be used to implement effective insecticide resistance management (IRM), with a focus on recent advances in the study of Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria in Africa. These advances unlock the potential for a predictive form of IRM, allowing tractable feedback for stakeholders, where the latest field data and well parameterised models can maximise the lifetime and effectiveness of available insecticides.","['1 Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, United Kingdom.

10,5,Is Anopheles gambiae a Natural Host of Wolbachia?,"Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales) is an intraovarially transmitted symbiont of insects able to exert striking phenotypes, including reproductive manipulations and pathogen blocking. These phenotypes make Wolbachia a promising tool to combat mosquito-borne diseases. Although Wolbachia is present in the majority of terrestrial arthropods, including many disease vectors, it was considered absent from Anopheles gambiae mosquitos, the main vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2014, Wolbachia sequences were detected in A. gambiae samples collected in Burkina Faso. Subsequently, similar evidence came from collections all over Africa, revealing a high Wolbachia 16S rRNA sequence diversity, low abundance, and a lack of congruence between host and symbiont phylogenies. Here, we reanalyze and discuss recent evidence on the presence of Wolbachia sequences in A. gambiae. We find that although detected at increasing frequencies, the unusual properties of these Wolbachia sequences render them insufficient to diagnose natural infections in A. gambiae Future studies should focus on uncovering the origin of Wolbachia sequence variants in Anopheles and seeking sequence-independent evidence for this new symbiosis. Understanding the ecology of Anopheles mosquitos and their interactions with Wolbachia will be key in designing successful, integrative approaches to limit malaria spread. Although the prospect of using Wolbachia to fight malaria is intriguing, the newly discovered strains do not bring it closer to realization.IMPORTANCEAnopheles gambiae mosquitos are the main vectors of malaria, threatening around half of the world's population. The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia can interfere with disease transmission by other important insect vectors, but until recently, it was thought to be absent from natural A. gambiae populations. Here, we critically analyze the genomic, metagenomic, PCR, imaging, and phenotypic data presented in support of the presence of natural Wolbachia infections in A. gambiae We find that they are insufficient to diagnose Wolbachia infections and argue for the need of obtaining robust data confirming basic Wolbachia characteristics in this system. Determining the Wolbachia infection status of Anopheles is critical due to its potential to influence Anopheles population structure and Plasmodium transmission.","['1 Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany echrostek@gmail.com mgerth@brookes.ac.uk.', '2 Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom.', '3 Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom echrostek@gmail.com mgerth@brookes.ac.uk.']","Ewa Chrostek, Michael Gerth, ",mBio,2019,endosymbionts; malaria; metagenomics; vector biology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31186318,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6561020/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6561020/pdf/mBio.00784-19.pdf
11,11,Anopheles parensis contributes to residual malaria transmission in South Africa,"Background:
        
      
      Understanding the contribution of outdoor-resting Anopheles mosquitoes to residual malaria transmission is important in terms of scaling up vector control towards malaria elimination in South Africa. The aim of this project was to assess the potential role of Anopheles parensis and other Anopheles species in residual malaria transmission, using sentinel surveillance sites in the uMkhanyakude District of northern KwaZulu-Natal Province. Methods:
        
      
      Monthly vector surveillance was conducted at the sentinel sites from January 2017 to May 2018. Outdoor-placed clay pot resting traps were used to collect male and female adult Anopheles mosquitoes. All Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group specimens collected were identified to species and all females were screened for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples showing infectivity for P. falciparum were further verified by a nested PCR and subsequent DNA sequence analysis. Results:
        
      
      From a sample of 491 anophelines, Anopheles arabiensis (n = 228) and An. parensis (n = 194) were the most abundant. Other species collected included Anopheles merus (n =11), Anopheles quadriannulatus (n = 10), Anopheles leesoni (n = 29), Anopheles rivulorum (n =18), and Anopheles vaneedeni (n =1). Of the 317 female specimens screened for P. falciparum CSP, one Anopheles arabiensis and one An. parensis showed positive by ELISA and Plasmodium nested PCR. For the An. parensis specimen, confirmation of its species identity was based on sequence analysis of the ITS2 region, and the presence of P. falciparum DNA was further confirmed by sequence analysis. Conclusions:
        
      
      Anopheles parensis is a potential vector of malaria in South Africa although its contribution to transmission is likely to be minimal at best owing to its strong zoophilic tendency. By contrast, An. arabiensis is a major vector that is primarily responsible for the bulk of residual malaria transmission in South Africa. As all recently collected sporozoite-positive Anopheles mosquitoes were found in outdoor-placed resting traps, it is necessary to introduce interventions that can be used to control outdoor-resting vector populations while maintaining the efficacy of South Africa's indoor house spraying operations.","['1 Wits Research Institute for Malaria and Wits/MRC Collaborating Centre for Multidisciplinary Research On Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '2 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '3 School of Animal, Plant & Environmental Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '4 Environmental Health, Malaria and Communicable Disease Control, KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health, Jozini, South Africa.', '5 Wits Research Institute for Malaria and Wits/MRC Collaborating Centre for Multidisciplinary Research On Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. basilb@nicd.ac.za.', '6 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa. basilb@nicd.ac.za.']","Ashley Burke, Yael Dahan-Moss, Frances Duncan, Bheki Qwabe, Maureen Coetzee, Lizette Koekemoer, Basil Brooke, ",Malaria journal,2019,Anopheles parensis; Incrimination; Plasmodium falciparum; Residual malaria; Secondary vector.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31358015,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6664530/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6664530/pdf/12936_2019_Article_2889.pdf
12,3,"Detection of Anopheles rivulorum-like, a member of the Anopheles funestus group, in South Africa","Background:
        
      
      The Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and Anopheles funestus s.l. species complexes contain the most important malaria vectors in Africa. Within the An. funestus group of at least 11 African species, the vector status of all but the nominal species An. funestus appears poorly investigated, although evidence exists that Anopheles rivulorum and Anopheles vaneedeni may play minor roles. A new species, An. rivulorum-like, was described from Burkina Faso in 2000 and subsequently also found in Cameroon and Zambia. This is the first paper reporting the presence of this species in South Africa, thereby significantly extending its known range. Methods:
        
      
      Mosquitoes were collected using dry-ice baited net traps and CDC light traps in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Sixty-four An. funestus s.l. among an overall 844 mosquitoes were captured and identified to species level using the polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were also analysed for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein using the enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay. Results:
        
      
      Four members of the An. funestus group were identified: An. rivulorum-like (n = 49), An. rivulorum (n = 11), Anopheles parensis (n = 2) and Anopheles leesoni (n = 1). One mosquito could not be identified. No evidence of P. falciparum was detected in any of the specimens. Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the first report of An. rivulorum-like south of Zambia, and essentially extends the range of this species from West Africa down to South Africa. Given the continental-scale drive towards malaria elimination and the challenges faced by countries in the elimination phase to understand and resolve residual transmission, efforts should be directed towards determining the largely unknown malaria vector potential of members of the An. funestus group and other potential secondary vectors.","['1 UP Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control & MRC Collaborating Centre for Malaria Research, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '2 Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, USA.', '3 Wits Research Institute for Malaria, MRC Collaborating Centre for Multi-disciplinary Research on Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '4 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '5 UP Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control & MRC Collaborating Centre for Malaria Research, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. leo.braack@up.ac.za.']","Joel Mouatcho, Anthony J Cornel, Yael Dahan-Moss, Lizette L Koekemoer, Maureen Coetzee, Leo Braack, ",Malaria journal,2018,An. rivulorum-like; Anopheles funestus; Malaria; Mosquitoes; South Africa; Vector distribution.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29764433,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5952852/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5952852/pdf/12936_2018_Article_2353.pdf
13,15,Mosquito microevolution drives Plasmodium falciparum dynamics,"Malaria, a major cause of child mortality in Africa, is engendered by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. Fitness of Plasmodium parasites is closely linked to the ecology and evolution of its anopheline vector. However, whether the genetic structure of vector populations impacts malaria transmission remains unknown. Here, we describe a partitioning of the African malaria vectors into generalists and specialists that evolve along ecological boundaries. We next identify the contribution of mosquito species to Plasmodium abundance using Granger causality tests for time-series data collected over two rainy seasons in Mali. We find that mosquito microevolution, defined by changes in the genetic structure of a population over short ecological timescales, drives Plasmodium dynamics in nature, whereas vector abundance, infection prevalence, temperature and rain have low predictive values. Our study demonstrates the power of time-series approaches in vector biology and highlights the importance of focusing local vector control strategies on mosquito species that drive malaria dynamics.","['1 Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany.', '2 University of Sciences, Techniques and Technology, Bamako, Mali.', '3 MIVEGEC, IRD, CNRS, Université Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', '4 Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale, Università degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', '5 Entomology Branch, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '6 International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Nairobi, Kenya.', '7 Yale School of Public Health, New Heaven, CT, USA.', '8 Malaria Research Laboratory, OCEAC, Yaounde, Cameroon.', '9 Faculté de Médecine et des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Université de Douala, Douala, Cameroon.', '10 UPR0922 CNRS, U963 Inserm, Université de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', '11 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '12 Pwani University Bioscience Research Centre, Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya.', '13 KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.', '14 Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.', '15 Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé/Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.', '16 Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.

14,8,"Insights into malaria transmission among Anopheles funestus mosquitoes, Kenya","Background:
        
      
      Most malaria vectors belong to species complexes. Sibling species often exhibit divergent behaviors dictating the measures that can be deployed effectively in their control. Despite the importance of the Anopheles funestus complex in malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, sibling species have rarely been identified in the past and their vectoring potential remains understudied. Methods:
        
      
      We analyzed 1149 wild-caught An. funestus (senso lato) specimens from 21 sites in Kenya, covering the major malaria endemic areas including western, central and coastal areas. Indoor and outdoor collection tools were used targeting host-seeking and resting mosquitoes. The identity of sibling species, infection with malaria Plasmodium parasites, and the host blood meal sources of engorged specimens were analyzed using PCR-based and sequencing methods. Results:
        
      
      The most abundant sibling species collected in all study sites were Anopheles funestus (59.8%) and Anopheles rivulorum (32.4%) among the 1062 successfully amplified specimens of the An. funestus complex. Proportionally, An. funestus dominated in indoor collections whilst An. rivulorum dominated in outdoor collections. Other species identified were Anopheles leesoni (4.6%), Anopheles parensis (2.4%), Anopheles vaneedeni (0.1%) and for the first time in Kenya, Anopheles longipalpis C (0.7%). Anopheles funestus had an overall Plasmodium infection rate of 9.7% (62/636), predominantly Plasmodium falciparum (59), with two infected with Plasmodium ovale and one with Plasmodium malariae. There was no difference in the infection rate between indoor and outdoor collections. Out of 344 An. rivulorum, only one carried P. falciparum. We also detected P. falciparum infection in two non-blood-fed An. longipalpis C (2/7) which is the first record for this species in Kenya. The mean human blood indices for An. funestus and An. rivulorum were 68% (93/136) and 64% (45/70), respectively, with feeding tendencies on a broad host range including humans and domestic animals such as cow, goat, sheep, chicken and pig. Conclusions:

15,18,Sequence-based identification of Anopheles species in eastern Ethiopia,"Background:
        
      
      The recent finding of a typically non-African Anopheles species in eastern Ethiopia emphasizes the need for detailed species identification and characterization for effective malaria vector surveillance. Molecular approaches increase the accuracy and interoperability of vector surveillance data. To develop effective molecular assays for Anopheles identification, it is important to evaluate different genetic loci for the ability to characterize species and population level variation. Here the utility of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) loci for detection of Anopheles species from understudied regions of eastern Ethiopia was investigated. Methods:
        
      
      Adult mosquitoes were collected from the Harewe locality (east) and Meki (east central) Ethiopia. PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed for portions of the ITS2 and COI loci. Both NCBI's Basic Local Alignment Search tool (BLAST) and phylogenetic analysis using a maximum-likelihood approach were performed to identify species of Anopheles specimens. Results:
        
      
      Two species from the east Ethiopian collection, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles pretoriensis were identified. Analyses of ITS2 locus resulted in delineation of both species. In contrast, analysis of COI locus could not be used to delineate An. arabiensis from other taxa in Anopheles gambiae complex, but could distinguish An. pretoriensis sequences from sister taxa. Conclusion:
        
      
      The lack of clarity from COI sequence analysis highlights potential challenges of species identification within species complexes. These results provide supporting data for the development of molecular assays for delineation of Anopheles in east Ethiopia.","['1 Department of Biology, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA. tamar_carter@baylor.edu.', '2 Department of Biology, Jigjiga University, Jigjiga, Ethiopia.', '3 Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA.']","Tamar E Carter, Solomon Yared, Shantoy Hansel, Karen Lopez, Daniel Janies, ",Malaria journal,2019,Anopheles arabiensis; Cytochrome oxidase subunit I; Horn of Africa; Internal transcribed spacer 2; Malaria; Phylogenetics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30992003,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6469081/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469081/pdf/12936_2019_Article_2768.pdf
16,6,Controlling mosquitoes with semiochemicals: a review,"The use of semiochemicals in odour-based traps for surveillance and control of vector mosquitoes is deemed a new and viable component for integrated vector management programmes. Over 114 semiochemicals have been identified, yet implementation of these for management of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever is still a major challenge. The difficulties arise due to variation in how different mosquito species respond to not only single chemical compounds but also complex chemical blends. Additionally, mosquitoes respond to different volatile blends when they are looking for a mating partner, oviposition sites or a meal. Analytically the challenge lies not only in correctly identifying these semiochemical signals and cues but also in developing formulations that effectively mimic blend ratios that different mosquito species respond to. Only then can the formulations be used to enhance the selectivity and efficacy of odour-based traps. Understanding how mosquitoes use semiochemical cues and signals to survive may be key to unravelling these complex interactions. An overview of the current studies of these chemical messages and the chemical ecology involved in complex behavioural patterns is given. This includes an updated list of the semiochemicals which can be used for integrated vector control management programmes. A thorough understanding of these semiochemical cues is of importance for the development of new vector control methods that can be integrated into established control strategies.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria, South Africa.', '2 Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria, South Africa. marc.bouwer@fabi.up.ac.za.']","Madelien Wooding, Yvette Naudé, Egmont Rohwer, Marc Bouwer, ",Parasites & vectors,2020,Aedes; Anopheles; Chemical communication; Culex; Malaria; Mosquito life-cycle; Semiochemicals; Vector mosquitoes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32066499,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7027039/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7027039/pdf/13071_2020_Article_3960.pdf
17,14,Past and current biological factors affecting malaria in the low transmission setting of Botswana: A review,"Malaria continues to be one of the top infectious agents contributing to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana. It also postulates that a comprehensive understanding of these aforementioned biological factors may help to explain malaria persistence in Botswana.","['1 Botswana-University of Pennsylvania Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.', '2 Botswana-University of Pennsylvania Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana; Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana.', '3 Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.', '4 Botswana-University of Pennsylvania Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana; Division of Infectious Diseases, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana.

18,20,African regional progress and status of the programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: 2000-2020,"To eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) by 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a campaign against the disease. Since the launch in 2000, significant progress has been made to achieve this ambitious goal. In this article we review the progress and status of the LF programme in Africa through the WHO neglected tropical diseases preventive chemotherapy databank, the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN) portal and other publications. In the African Region there are 35 countries endemic for LF. The Gambia was reclassified as not requiring preventive chemotherapy in 2015, while Togo and Malawi eliminated LF as a public health problem in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Cameroon discontinued mass drug administration (MDA) and transitioned to post-MDA surveillance to validate elimination. The trajectory of coverage continues to accelerate; treatment coverage increased from 0.1% in 2000 to 62.1% in 2018. Geographical coverage has also significantly increased, from 62.7% in 2015 to 78.5% in 2018. In 2019, 23 of 31 countries requiring MDA achieved 100% geographic coverage. Although much remains to be done, morbidity management and disability prevention services have steadily increased in recent years. Vector control interventions conducted by other programmes, particularly malaria vector control, have had a profound effect in stopping transmission in some endemic countries in the region. In conclusion, significant progress has been made in the LF programme in the region while we identify the key remaining challenges in achieving an Africa free of LF.","['1 Expanded Special Project for Elimination of NTDs, World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa, Cité du Djoué, P.O.

19,7,Malaria Vectors and Vector Surveillance in Limpopo Province (South Africa): 1927 to 2018,"Despite the annual implementation of a robust and extensive indoor residual spraying programme against malaria vectors in Limpopo Province (South Africa), significant transmission continues and is a serious impediment to South Africa's malaria elimination objectives. In order to gain a better understanding regarding possible causes of this residual malaria, we conducted a literature review of the historical species composition and abundance of malaria vector mosquitoes in the Limpopo River Valley region of the Vhembe District, northern Limpopo Province, the region with the highest remaining annual malaria cases in South Africa. In addition, mosquito surveys were carried out in the same region between October 2017 and October 2018. A total of 2225 adult mosquitoes were collected using CO2-baited tent and light traps, human landing catches and cow-baited traps. Of the 1443 Anopheles collected, 516 were members of the An. gambiae complex and 511 An. funestus group. In the malaria endemic rural areas outside the Kruger National Park, one specimen each of An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus and only three of An. arabiensis were collected. The latter species was abundant at a remote hot spring in the neighboring Kruger National Park. Eighteen other species of Anopheles were collected. Our survey results support the historical findings that An. arabiensis, the species widely held to be the prime malaria vector in South Africa, is a rare species in the malaria endemic Limpopo River Valley. The implications of the mosquito surveys for malaria transmission, elimination and vector control in northern Limpopo Province and neighboring regions are discussed.","['1 University of Pretoria Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control, School of Health Systems and Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', '2 Vector Control Reference Laboratory, Centre for Emerging, Zoonotic & Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg2001, South Africa.', '3 Wits Research Institute for Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2001, South Africa.', '4 Department of Entomology & Nematology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '5 The W Harry Feinstone Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']","Leo Braack, Riana Bornman, Taneshka Kruger, Yael Dahan-Moss, Allison Gilbert, Maria Kaiser, Shüné V Oliver, Anthony J Cornel, Yoosook Lee, Douglas E Norris, Maureen Coetzee, Basil Brooke, Christiaan de Jager, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,Anopheles; Limpopo Province; South Africa; malaria; vector surveillance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32527067,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7313001/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313001/pdf/ijerph-17-04125.pdf
