0,"Implementing malaria control in South Africa, Eswatini and southern Mozambique during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare delivery systems in a number of southern African countries. Despite this, it is imperative that malaria control and elimination activities continue, especially to reduce as far as possible the number and rate of hospitalisations caused by malaria. The implementation of enhanced malaria control/elimination activities in the context of COVID-19 requires measures to protect healthcare workers and the communities they serve. The aim of this review is therefore to present innovative ideas for the timely implementation of malaria control without increasing the risk of COVID-19 to healthcare workers and communities. Specific recommendations for parasite and vector surveillance, diagnosis, case management, mosquito vector control and community outreach and sensitisation are given.","['1 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa; Wits Research Institute for Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. lucilleb@nicd.ac.za.']","B D Brooke, J Raman, J Frean, J Rundle, F Maartens, E Misiani, A Mabuza, K I Barnes, D P Moonasar, Q Dlamini, S Charles, L Blumberg, ",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403980,False,,
1,African regional progress and status of the programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: 2000-2020,"To eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) by 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a campaign against the disease. Since the launch in 2000, significant progress has been made to achieve this ambitious goal. In this article we review the progress and status of the LF programme in Africa through the WHO neglected tropical diseases preventive chemotherapy databank, the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN) portal and other publications. In the African Region there are 35 countries endemic for LF. The Gambia was reclassified as not requiring preventive chemotherapy in 2015, while Togo and Malawi eliminated LF as a public health problem in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Cameroon discontinued mass drug administration (MDA) and transitioned to post-MDA surveillance to validate elimination. The trajectory of coverage continues to accelerate; treatment coverage increased from 0.1% in 2000 to 62.1% in 2018. Geographical coverage has also significantly increased, from 62.7% in 2015 to 78.5% in 2018. In 2019, 23 of 31 countries requiring MDA achieved 100% geographic coverage. Although much remains to be done, morbidity management and disability prevention services have steadily increased in recent years. Vector control interventions conducted by other programmes, particularly malaria vector control, have had a profound effect in stopping transmission in some endemic countries in the region. In conclusion, significant progress has been made in the LF programme in the region while we identify the key remaining challenges in achieving an Africa free of LF.","['1 Expanded Special Project for Elimination of NTDs, World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa, Cité du Djoué, P.O.

2,Modeling the effects of insecticides resistance on malaria vector control in endemic regions of Kenya,"We present a model to investigate the effects of vector resistance to control strategies. The model captures the development of resistance as well as loss of resistance in mosquitoes and how these affect the progress in malaria control. Important thresholds were calculated from mathematical analysis and numerical results presented. Mathematical results reveal the existence of the disease free and endemic equilibria whose existence and stability depends on the control reproduction number, Rc. The disease persist when the Rc>1 and dies out when Rc<1. Control strategies use and adherence needs to be highly efficacious to thwart the effects of insecticides resistance. Moreover, it is not enough to just eradicate resistant mosquitoes.","['1 University of Nairobi, Kenya. Electronic address: jwndirangu@uonbi.ac.ke.', '2 University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

3,The need for new vector control approaches targeting outdoor biting Anopheline malaria vector communities,"Since the implementation of Roll Back Malaria, the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) is thought to have played a major part in the decrease in mortality and morbidity achieved in malaria-endemic regions. In the past decade, resistance to major classes of insecticides recommended for public health has spread across many malaria vector populations. Increasingly, malaria vectors are also showing changes in vector behaviour in response to current indoor chemical vector control interventions. Changes in the time of biting and proportion of indoor biting of major vectors, as well as changes in the species composition of mosquito communities threaten the progress made to control malaria transmission. Outdoor biting mosquito populations contribute to malaria transmission in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and pose new challenges as they cannot be reliably monitored or controlled using conventional tools. Here, we review existing and novel approaches that may be used to target outdoor communities of malaria vectors. We conclude that scalable tools designed specifically for the control and monitoring of outdoor biting and resting malaria vectors with increasingly complex and dynamic responses to intensifying malaria control interventions are urgently needed. These are crucial for integrated vector management programmes designed to challenge current and future vector populations.","['1 Centre of Applied Entomology and Parasitology, School of Life Sciences, Keele University, Staffordshire, UK.', '2 Centre of Applied Entomology and Parasitology, School of Life Sciences, Keele University, Staffordshire, UK. f.tripet@keele.ac.uk.']","Seynabou Sougoufara, Emmanuel Chinweuba Ottih, Frederic Tripet, ",Parasites & vectors,2020,Anopheles; Exophagy; Exophily; Mosquitoes; Outdoor biting; Pesticide resistance; Traps.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32522290,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7285743/,
4,A discovery and development roadmap for new endectocidal transmission-blocking agents in malaria,"Reaching the overall goal of eliminating malaria requires halting disease transmission. One approach to blocking transmission is to prevent passage of the parasite to a mosquito, by preventing formation or transmission of gametocytes. An alternative approach, pioneered in the veterinary field, is to use endectocides, which are molecules that render vertebrate blood meals toxic for the mosquito vector, also killing the parasite. Field studies and modelling suggest that reducing the lifespan of the mosquito may significantly reduce transmission, given the lengthy maturation process of the parasite. To guide the development of new endectocides, or the reformulation of existing molecules, it is important to construct a framework of the required attributes, commonly called the target candidate profile. Here, using a combination of insights from current endectocides, mathematical models of the malaria transmission dynamics, and known impacts of vector control, a target candidate profile (TCP-6) and a regulatory strategy are proposed for a transmission reducing agent. The parameters chosen can be used to assess the potential of a new medicine, independent of whether it has classical endectocide activity, reduces the insect and parasite lifespan or any combination of all three, thereby constituting an 'endectocidal transmission blocking' paradigm.","['1 Medicines for Malaria Venture, Route de Pré Bois 20, 1215, Geneva 15, Switzerland. burrowsj@mmv.org.', '2 PATH, 2201 Westlake Avenue, Seattle, WA, 98121, USA.', '3 Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, MRC Centre for Global Disease Analysis, Imperial College London, Norfolk Place, London, W2 1PG, UK.', '4 Medicines for Malaria Venture, Route de Pré Bois 20, 1215, Geneva 15, Switzerland.', '5 Innovative Vector Control Consortium, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Pembroke Place, Liverpool, L3 5QA, UK.', '6 Environmental Health and Ecological Sciences Department, Ifakara Health Institute, Off Mlabani Passage, Ifakara, Morogoro, United Republic of Tanzania.', '7 School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Parktown, Republic of South Africa.', '8 Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']","Jeremy Burrows, Hannah Slater, Fiona Macintyre, Sarah Rees, Anna Thomas, Fredros Okumu, Rob Hooft van Huijsduijnen, Stephan Duparc, Timothy N C Wells, ",Malaria journal,2018,Endectocides; Malaria; Plasmodium; Target product profile; Transmission blocking; Transmission reducing agent; target candidate profile.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30526594,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6287360/,
5,Rolling back malaria in Africa - challenges and opportunities to winning the elimination battle,"A high-level review was conducted of the literature pertaining to the challenges and opportunities for eliminating malaria on the African continent. Although malaria mortality and morbidity are on the decline, the disease remains one of public health importance. Africa has invariably borne the brunt of the disease, recording the highest number of cases and deaths. However, with greater emphasis being placed on the disease by the international community, partnerships have developed to boost malaria elimination efforts on the continent. One such initiative is the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership which aims to facilitate malaria elimination through increasing resources and awareness. Many cross-border initiatives have been established which treat malaria as a regional problem rather than a country-specific one. Accelerated malaria control efforts have led to a 37% decrease in cases and 60% reduction in deaths. Multi-country efforts have resulted in marked reductions of transmission in the region. Although there have been noteworthy gains in curtailing the disease, new challenges have arisen. The main among these are residual malaria and outdoor biting. One of the main drivers of residual malaria is insecticide resistance. Adding to the burden of residual transmission is the discovery of new vectors that may exist at low densities. To exacerbate these issues is the challenge of malaria imported from high- to low-transmission areas. Nevertheless, compared with the historical picture, we are winning the battle against malaria. Countries in Africa are being certified malaria-free. Partnerships have been developed to take forward the RBM Global Malaria Action Plan. Elimination agendas can only be successful if funding remains sustainable, with greater reliance on domestic funding.","['1 Office of Malaria Research, South African Medical Research Council, Durban, South Africa. rajendra.maharaj@mrc.ac.za.']","R Maharaj, S Kissoon, V Lakan, N Kheswa, ",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32252869,False,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2019.v109i11b.14250,
6,Controlling mosquitoes with semiochemicals: a review,"The use of semiochemicals in odour-based traps for surveillance and control of vector mosquitoes is deemed a new and viable component for integrated vector management programmes. Over 114 semiochemicals have been identified, yet implementation of these for management of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever is still a major challenge. The difficulties arise due to variation in how different mosquito species respond to not only single chemical compounds but also complex chemical blends. Additionally, mosquitoes respond to different volatile blends when they are looking for a mating partner, oviposition sites or a meal. Analytically the challenge lies not only in correctly identifying these semiochemical signals and cues but also in developing formulations that effectively mimic blend ratios that different mosquito species respond to. Only then can the formulations be used to enhance the selectivity and efficacy of odour-based traps. Understanding how mosquitoes use semiochemical cues and signals to survive may be key to unravelling these complex interactions. An overview of the current studies of these chemical messages and the chemical ecology involved in complex behavioural patterns is given. This includes an updated list of the semiochemicals which can be used for integrated vector control management programmes. A thorough understanding of these semiochemical cues is of importance for the development of new vector control methods that can be integrated into established control strategies.","['1 Department of Chemistry, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria, South Africa.', '2 Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria, South Africa. marc.bouwer@fabi.up.ac.za.']","Madelien Wooding, Yvette Naudé, Egmont Rohwer, Marc Bouwer, ",Parasites & vectors,2020,Aedes; Anopheles; Chemical communication; Culex; Malaria; Mosquito life-cycle; Semiochemicals; Vector mosquitoes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32066499,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7027039/,
7,Breathprinting Reveals Malaria-Associated Biomarkers and Mosquito Attractants,"Current evidence suggests that malarial infection could alter metabolites in the breath of patients, a phenomenon that could be exploited to create a breath-based diagnostic test. However, no study has explored this in a clinical setting. To investigate whether natural human malarial infection leads to a characteristic breath profile, we performed a field study in Malawi. Breath volatiles from children with and those without uncomplicated falciparum malaria were analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Using an unbiased, correlation-based analysis, we found that children with malaria have a distinct shift in overall breath composition. Highly accurate classification of infection status was achieved with a suite of 6 compounds. In addition, we found that infection correlates with significantly higher breath levels of 2 mosquito-attractant terpenes, α-pinene and 3-carene. These findings attest to the viability of breath analysis for malaria diagnosis, identify candidate biomarkers, and identify plausible chemical mediators for increased mosquito attraction to patients infected with malaria parasites.","['1 Department of Pediatrics, St. Louis, Missouri.', '2 Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.', '4 Lilongwe District Health Office, Malawi Ministry of Health, Blantyre, Malawi.', '5 Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Malawi College of Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi.', '6 Department of Pediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, Malawi.']","Chad L Schaber, Nalin Katta, Lucy B Bollinger, Mwawi Mwale, Rachel Mlotha-Mitole, Indi Trehan, Barani Raman, Audrey R Odom John, ",The Journal of infectious diseases,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29415208,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6279169/,
8,Stochastic lattice-based modelling of malaria dynamics,"Background:
        
      
      The transmission of malaria is highly variable and depends on a range of climatic and anthropogenic factors. In addition, the dispersal of Anopheles mosquitoes is a key determinant that affects the persistence and dynamics of malaria. Simple, lumped-population models of malaria prevalence have been insufficient for predicting the complex responses of malaria to environmental changes. Methods and results:
        
      
      A stochastic lattice-based model that couples a mosquito dispersal and a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered epidemics model was developed for predicting the dynamics of malaria in heterogeneous environments. The It[Formula: see text] approximation of stochastic integrals with respect to Brownian motion was used to derive a model of stochastic differential equations. The results show that stochastic equations that capture uncertainties in the life cycle of mosquitoes and interactions among vectors, parasites, and hosts provide a mechanism for the disruptions of malaria. Finally, model simulations for a case study in the rural area of Kilifi county, Kenya are presented. Conclusions:
        
      
      A stochastic lattice-based integrated malaria model has been developed. The applicability of the model for capturing the climate-driven hydrologic factors and demographic variability on malaria transmission has been demonstrated.","['1 Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA.', '2 Faculty of Hydrology, Meteorology and Oceanography, Hanoi University of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam.', '3 Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA. kumar1@illinois.edu.', '4 Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA. kumar1@illinois.edu.', '5 Department of Pathobiology, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, 61802, USA.']","Phong V V Le, Praveen Kumar, Marilyn O Ruiz, ",Malaria journal,2018,Climate change; Ecohydrology; Malaria; Metapopulation; Stochastic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976221,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6034346/,
9,Current Situation of Malaria in Africa,"Malaria infection is one of the major causes of deaths in the African continent. The high burden of malaria in Africa is due to P. falciparum, which adapts and cospecializes with Anopheles gambiae, the most effective and widespread malaria vector. Since 2000, the incidence of malaria has been reduced by 17% and malaria mortality rates by 26%. However, the rate of decline has stalled and even reversed in some regions since 2014. In 2017 as described by the latest World malaria report, 219 million malaria cases were reported, up from 2017 million cases reported in 2016 in 91 countries, and the global tally of malaria deaths reached 435,000 deaths, compared with 451,000 estimated deaths in 2016. Despite these achievements, the African region continues to account for about 92% of malaria cases and deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is important to master the current situation of malaria in Africa to see how to better plan its elimination. In this chapter, we present the current situation and prospective means to improve it, including a salutogenesis approach.","['1 Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé 1, Yaoundé, Cameroon. wfmbacham@yahoo.com.', '2 Malaria Research Unit, Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaoundé, Cameroon.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé 1, Yaoundé, Cameroon.', '4 Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM), Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation, Yaoundé, Cameroon.']","Wilfred Fon Mbacham, Lawrence Ayong, Magellan Guewo-Fokeng, Valerie Makoge, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",NO_DATE,Africa; Burden; Malaria; Salutogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31267491,False,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9550-9_2,
10,Malaria Vectors and Vector Surveillance in Limpopo Province (South Africa): 1927 to 2018,"Despite the annual implementation of a robust and extensive indoor residual spraying programme against malaria vectors in Limpopo Province (South Africa), significant transmission continues and is a serious impediment to South Africa's malaria elimination objectives. In order to gain a better understanding regarding possible causes of this residual malaria, we conducted a literature review of the historical species composition and abundance of malaria vector mosquitoes in the Limpopo River Valley region of the Vhembe District, northern Limpopo Province, the region with the highest remaining annual malaria cases in South Africa. In addition, mosquito surveys were carried out in the same region between October 2017 and October 2018. A total of 2225 adult mosquitoes were collected using CO2-baited tent and light traps, human landing catches and cow-baited traps. Of the 1443 Anopheles collected, 516 were members of the An. gambiae complex and 511 An. funestus group. In the malaria endemic rural areas outside the Kruger National Park, one specimen each of An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus and only three of An. arabiensis were collected. The latter species was abundant at a remote hot spring in the neighboring Kruger National Park. Eighteen other species of Anopheles were collected. Our survey results support the historical findings that An. arabiensis, the species widely held to be the prime malaria vector in South Africa, is a rare species in the malaria endemic Limpopo River Valley. The implications of the mosquito surveys for malaria transmission, elimination and vector control in northern Limpopo Province and neighboring regions are discussed.","['1 University of Pretoria Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control, School of Health Systems and Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', '2 Vector Control Reference Laboratory, Centre for Emerging, Zoonotic & Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg2001, South Africa.', '3 Wits Research Institute for Malaria, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2001, South Africa.', '4 Department of Entomology & Nematology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '5 The W Harry Feinstone Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']","Leo Braack, Riana Bornman, Taneshka Kruger, Yael Dahan-Moss, Allison Gilbert, Maria Kaiser, Shüné V Oliver, Anthony J Cornel, Yoosook Lee, Douglas E Norris, Maureen Coetzee, Basil Brooke, Christiaan de Jager, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,Anopheles; Limpopo Province; South Africa; malaria; vector surveillance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32527067,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7313001/,

12,Mathematical modeling of climate change and malaria transmission dynamics: a historical review,"Malaria, one of the greatest historical killers of mankind, continues to claim around half a million lives annually, with almost all deaths occurring in children under the age of five living in tropical Africa. The range of this disease is limited by climate to the warmer regions of the globe, and so anthropogenic global warming (and climate change more broadly) now threatens to alter the geographic area for potential malaria transmission, as both the Plasmodium malaria parasite and Anopheles mosquito vector have highly temperature-dependent lifecycles, while the aquatic immature Anopheles habitats are also strongly dependent upon rainfall and local hydrodynamics. A wide variety of process-based (or mechanistic) mathematical models have thus been proposed for the complex, highly nonlinear weather-driven Anopheles lifecycle and malaria transmission dynamics, but have reached somewhat disparate conclusions as to optimum temperatures for transmission, and the possible effect of increasing temperatures upon (potential) malaria distribution, with some projecting a large increase in the area at risk for malaria, but others predicting primarily a shift in the disease's geographic range. More generally, both global and local environmental changes drove the initial emergence of P. falciparum as a major human pathogen in tropical Africa some 10,000 years ago, and the disease has a long and deep history through the present. It is the goal of this paper to review major aspects of malaria biology, methods for formalizing these into mathematical forms, uncertainties and controversies in proper modeling methodology, and to provide a timeline of some major modeling efforts from the classical works of Sir Ronald Ross and George Macdonald through recent climate-focused modeling studies. Finally, we attempt to place such mathematical work within a broader historical context for the ""million-murdering Death"" of malaria.","['1 Global Security Initiative, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. seikenbe@asu.edu.', '2 School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. seikenbe@asu.edu.', '3 School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.']","Steffen E Eikenberry, Abba B Gumel, ",Journal of mathematical biology,NO_DATE,Climate change; Malaria; Ross–Macdonald; Thermal-response.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29691632,False,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-018-1229-7,

14,Mosquitoes cloak their legs to resist insecticides,"Malaria incidence has halved since the year 2000, with 80% of the reduction attributable to the use of insecticides. However, insecticide resistance is now widespread, is rapidly increasing in spectrum and intensity across Africa, and may be contributing to the increase of malaria incidence in 2018. The role of detoxification enzymes and target site mutations has been documented in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae; however, the emergence of striking resistant phenotypes suggests the occurrence of additional mechanisms. By comparing legs, the most relevant insect tissue for insecticide uptake, we show that resistant mosquitoes largely remodel their leg cuticles via enhanced deposition of cuticular proteins and chitin, corroborating a leg-thickening phenotype. Moreover, we show that resistant female mosquitoes seal their leg cuticles with higher total and different relative amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons, compared with susceptible ones. The structural and functional alterations in Anopheles female mosquito legs are associated with a reduced uptake of insecticides, substantially contributing to the resistance phenotype.","['1 Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas, Heraklion 70013, Greece.', '2 Department of Biology, University of Crete, Vassilika Vouton, Heraklion 70013, Greece.', '3 Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', '4 Functional Proteomics and Systems Biology (FunPATh), Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation (CIRI-AUTH), Balkan Center, Thessaloniki, Greece.', '5 Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de La Plata, Centro Científico Tecnológico La Plata, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas-Facultad de Ciencias Médicas, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, La Plata 1900, Argentina.', '6 Pesticide Science Laboratory, Department of Crop Science, Agricultural University of Athens, 11855 Athens, Greece.', '7 Department of Vector Biology, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool L3 5QA, UK.']","Vasileia Balabanidou, Mary Kefi, Michalis Aivaliotis, Venetia Koidou, Juan R Girotti, Sergio J Mijailovsky, M Patricia Juárez, Eva Papadogiorgaki, George Chalepakis, Anastasia Kampouraki, Christoforos Nikolaou, Hilary Ranson, John Vontas, ",Proceedings.

Here, we present a report dedicated to entomological aspects of CHIKV, ONNV and MAYV. Recent global expansion of chikungunya virus has been possible because CHIKV established a transmission cycle in urban settings using anthropophilic vectors such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. MAYV and ONNV have a more limited geographic distribution, being confined to Africa (ONNV) and central-southern America (MAYV). ONNV is probably maintained through an enzootic cycle that has not been characterized yet, with Anopheles species as main vectors and humans as amplification hosts during epidemics. MAYV is transmitted by Haemagogus species in an enzootic cycle using non-human primates as the main amplification and maintenance hosts, and humans becoming sporadically infected when venturing in or nearby forest habitats. Here, we focused on the transmission cycle and natural vectors that sustain circulation of these viruses in their respective locations. The knowledge of the natural ecology of transmission and the capacity of different vectors to transmit these viruses is crucial to understand CHIKV emergence, and to assess the risk that MAYV and ONNV will expand on wide scale using anthropophilic mosquito species not normally considered primary vectors. Finally, the experts identified knowledge gaps and provided adapted recommendations, in order to address future entomological investigations in the right direction.","['1 Unité des Virus Émergents (UVE: Aix-Marseille Univ-IRD 190-Inserm 1207-IHU Méditerranée Infection), Marseille, France; EA7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Université de Corse-Inserm, Corte, France.

16,Mosquito microevolution drives Plasmodium falciparum dynamics,"Malaria, a major cause of child mortality in Africa, is engendered by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. Fitness of Plasmodium parasites is closely linked to the ecology and evolution of its anopheline vector. However, whether the genetic structure of vector populations impacts malaria transmission remains unknown. Here, we describe a partitioning of the African malaria vectors into generalists and specialists that evolve along ecological boundaries. We next identify the contribution of mosquito species to Plasmodium abundance using Granger causality tests for time-series data collected over two rainy seasons in Mali. We find that mosquito microevolution, defined by changes in the genetic structure of a population over short ecological timescales, drives Plasmodium dynamics in nature, whereas vector abundance, infection prevalence, temperature and rain have low predictive values. Our study demonstrates the power of time-series approaches in vector biology and highlights the importance of focusing local vector control strategies on mosquito species that drive malaria dynamics.","['1 Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany.', '2 University of Sciences, Techniques and Technology, Bamako, Mali.', '3 MIVEGEC, IRD, CNRS, Université Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', '4 Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale, Università degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', '5 Entomology Branch, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '6 International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Nairobi, Kenya.', '7 Yale School of Public Health, New Heaven, CT, USA.', '8 Malaria Research Laboratory, OCEAC, Yaounde, Cameroon.', '9 Faculté de Médecine et des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Université de Douala, Douala, Cameroon.', '10 UPR0922 CNRS, U963 Inserm, Université de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', '11 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '12 Pwani University Bioscience Research Centre, Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya.', '13 KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.', '14 Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK.', '15 Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé/Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.', '16 Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.

17,Cerebral malaria,"Malaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.","['1 Department of Parasitology, National Institute of Biomedical Research, BP 1187 Kinshasa, Gombe, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

18,The genomics of insecticide resistance: insights from recent studies in African malaria vectors,"Over 80% of the world's population is at risk from arthropod-vectored diseases, and arthropod crop pests are a significant threat to food security. Insecticides are our front-line response for controlling these disease vectors and pests, and consequently the increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance is of global concern. Here we provide a brief overview of how genomics can be used to implement effective insecticide resistance management (IRM), with a focus on recent advances in the study of Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria in Africa. These advances unlock the potential for a predictive form of IRM, allowing tractable feedback for stakeholders, where the latest field data and well parameterised models can maximise the lifetime and effectiveness of available insecticides.","['1 Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton CB10 1SA, United Kingdom.

19,Pareto rules for malaria super-spreaders and super-spreading,"Heterogeneity in transmission is a challenge for infectious disease dynamics and control. An 80-20 ""Pareto"" rule has been proposed to describe this heterogeneity whereby 80% of transmission is accounted for by 20% of individuals, herein called super-spreaders. It is unclear, however, whether super-spreading can be attributed to certain individuals or whether it is an unpredictable and unavoidable feature of epidemics. Here, we investigate heterogeneous malaria transmission at three sites in Uganda and find that super-spreading is negatively correlated with overall malaria transmission intensity. Mosquito biting among humans is 90-10 at the lowest transmission intensities declining to less than 70-30 at the highest intensities. For super-spreaders, biting ranges from 70-30 down to 60-40. The difference, approximately half the total variance, is due to environmental stochasticity. Super-spreading is thus partly due to super-spreaders, but modest gains are expected from targeting super-spreaders.","['1 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', '2 Department of Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.', '3 Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '4 RTI International, Washington, DC, USA.', '5 Epidemiology and Public Health Division, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.', '6 Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration, Kampala, Uganda.', '7 Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '8 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', '9 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', '10 Institute for Disease Modeling, Bellevue, WA, USA.', '11 Department of Health Metrics Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '12 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', '13 School of Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.', '14 School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK.', '15 Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', '16 Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '17 Department of Health Metrics Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. smitdave@uw.edu.', '18 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. smitdave@uw.edu.']","Laura Cooper, Su Yun Kang, Donal Bisanzio, Kilama Maxwell, Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer, Bryan Greenhouse, Chris Drakeley, Emmanuel Arinaitwe, Sarah G Staedke, Peter W Gething, Philip Eckhoff, Robert C Reiner Jr, Simon I Hay, Grant Dorsey, Moses R Kamya, Steven W Lindsay, Bryan T Grenfell, David L Smith, ",Nature communications,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31477710,True,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6718398/,
